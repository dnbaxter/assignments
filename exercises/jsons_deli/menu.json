        "description": "The meaty backbone of the banh mi -- often a trifecta of moist roast pork, velvety pate, and gelatinous head cheese -- is satiating on its own, but it's the delicate balance between spicy jalape√±os and soothing cucumbers, cilantro, and shredded carrots that makes the banh Mmi an edible work of art."

],
        "description": "Traditionally cut from 24in rolls, a regular po-boy is a full foot long. The second is the filling, which could be any number of things, but really should be either fried shrimp or oysters. An entire plate's worth of them. Dress it up with lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo, and some sauce, and you have a crunchy, toasty, fatty meal that just might be the best sandwich on the face of the planet."
